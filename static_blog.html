	<p class="left_border">We cannot live without breathing but is the air we breathe killing us? Some people are so worried about this that they have come up with an innovative way of purifying it. In the UK, a scientist and a poet have joined forces to develop giant nanotech posters that gobble up air pollution and carry a poem in praise of air. Although these innovators are not alone in their endeavours, we need more of them. Seven million deaths annually are linked to air pollution, according to the World Health Organisation which recently classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans.</p>
	<p>Air pollution is set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality by 2050, ahead of dirty water and lack of sanitation. A recent OECD report, The Cost of Air Pollution: Health Impacts of Road Transport, provides evidence that the health impacts from air pollution are about four times greater than previously estimated and that economic costs are significantly higher than previously thought.</p>
    <p>Air quality is deteriorating in many of the world’s cities in particular. Although clean air cannot be bought in a bottle, cities can adopt measures that clean the air and save the lives of their people. For example, the city of Paris put in place alternated traffic rules in March because it suffered from dangerously high pollution levels.  This measure had a positive impact on the city’s air pollution, with the government recording a 6% decrease in the levels of PM10, tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung.</p>

    <h2>This Is Another Article</h2>
    <p class="left_border">“Paris sera toujours Paris, la plus belle ville du monde”, as Maurice Chevalier sang in 1939; the most beautiful city in the world! And yet, the city of light does not always shine: some days a year air quality is so bad that the Eiffel tower only looks like a faraway shade. Unfortunately, Paris is not the only place with air pollution problems and it is far from being the worst. The average yearly concentrations of PM2.5 were 18 µg/m3 in Paris in 2014, which is above the levels recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). But they were much higher in other cities, such as the Beijing area where they were more than 90 µg/m3.</p>
    <p>Air pollution is a serious issue in most countries around the world and every year it causes severe damage to human health and the environment. The WHO estimates that ambient air pollution is the greatest environmental risk to health – causing more than 3 million premature deaths worldwide every year. Besides such a high death toll, air pollution affects human health, especially through respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, there are strong effects on the environment, both natural and man-made. Think of all the beautiful monuments and buildings that regularly need cleaning because of the damages of air pollution…</p>
    <p>None of this is really new, and air pollution has been a priority in environmental policy for decades. Yet it is still unresolved and clearly worsening in many areas of the world. To further motivate policy action, the report The Economic Consequences of Outdoor Air Pollution presents projections of emissions and concentrations of key pollutants, the related number of premature deaths, impacts on illness and on crop yields, and the resulting costs of outdoor air pollution.</p>
